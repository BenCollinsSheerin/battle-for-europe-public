  "description": "With the release of 0.2, Battle for Europe has been totally overhauled. With new systems to manage the economy, land warfare, naval warfare and diplomacy. For a full overview and tutorial, please check the video embedded on the game's itch.io page.\n\nYou will now need to develop the infrastructure of your territories. The number of orders you can issue in a territory depends on the development of the infrastructure.\n\nRandom chance has been removed from combat. The number of casualties you will take or deal depends on the number of divisions multiplied by the attack or defence modifier.\n\nNaval battles follow the same rules, the number of warships multiplied by the attack or defence modifier respectively.\n\nYour relationship with foreign countries exists on a scale ranging from War, Embargo, Neutral, Trade Agreement and Alliance. It is cheaper to damage a relationship than to improve it.\n\nBug reports and suggestions for content or mechanics can be made via Discord.",
